# ETL Mini Project

Challenge:
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
We challenged ourselves by completing both options 1 and 2, by first extracting and transforming the data with the Python dictionary method and then by using regular expressions.

The ETL mini project instructions and requirements are located on Canvas.
